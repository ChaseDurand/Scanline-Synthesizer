# Scanline Synthesizer
Scanline Synthesizer uses rows of pixels to create wavetables with red, blue, and green oscillators.

Inspired by Marko Ciciliani's whitepaper ([.pdf link](http://www.ciciliani.com/uploads/1/3/1/5/131556658/ciciliani_scanline_synthesis.pdf)).

Many elements forked from [Joshua Hodge's tapSynth](https://github.com/TheAudioProgrammer/tapSynth).
